# 📰 Fake News Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains the implementation and findings of the research project **“Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches for Fake News Classification.”** The project evaluates and compares the performance of four machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—for detecting fake news, with a strong emphasis on generalization performance and model robustness.

## Overview
Fake news detection is a critical problem in modern information systems. This project goes beyond raw accuracy by analyzing how well different machine learning models generalize to unseen data. Techniques such as regularization, pruning, feature selection, and k-fold cross-validation are applied to reduce overfitting and improve reliability.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

## Methodology
The workflow includes data preprocessing and feature extraction, model training using multiple algorithms, application of overfitting reduction techniques, k-fold cross-validation, and a comparative evaluation of model performance.

## Evaluation Focus
Model performance is assessed using accuracy, cross-validation scores, and training vs testing performance comparisons to better understand generalization behavior.

## Key Insights
Ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed stronger generalization capabilities, while regularization and pruning significantly helped reduce overfitting across models.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for academic and research purposes. Model predictions should not be treated as definitive judgments of news authenticity.
